# better-hydra-missiles
A better heat seeking missiles targetting and launching system for MTA San Andreas

Demo:
https://youtu.be/IZ-gPio3d3o

# Installation
1. Make a new folder in `YOUR_MTA_SERVER/mods/deathmatch/resources`
2. Put all the files in here into that folder you just created

# Usage
When you're in a Hydra, all vehicles that are in front of you (within your 120 degree view) get "locked on" after 2 seconds.

Lockon is disengaged if the target goes off camera, or is not in front of the hydra anymore.
You can have multiple vehicles "locked on" at the same time. Press the horn button (capslock) or use the mousewheel to cycle through potential targets.

Holding space and firing a missile will fire a heat seeking missile towards the currently targetted locked on vehicle.
Firing a missile without space held will just fire it forward, totally normally.

# Customization
The top of the script (`missile.lua`) has some variables you can easily edit to change the behavior of the script.

```lua
local SHOOT_COOLDOWN = 1000 --Cooldown between homing shots
local LOCKON_TIME = 2000 --Time required to lock on to a target
local LOCK_RANGE = 330 --Maximum distance between you and the target
local LOCK_ANGLE = 1.0472 --(in radians) We cannot lock on targets unless they are within this angle of the front of the hydra
local VALID_TARGET_FUNCTION = nil --Used to decide whether a vehicle should appear as a lock-on option
```

## SHOOT_COOLDOWN:

Cooldown between homing rockets, in miliseconds

## LOCKON_TIME:

Time duration between the target being visible on screen and the target getting locked

## LOCK_RANGE:

The maximum range of lockon for missiles (in metres)

## LOCK_ANGLE:

The angle (on each side) (in radians) that is permissible for targetting

## VALID_TARGET_FUNCTION:

Every vehicle that is visible is passed to this function, and only if it returns true does it allow it to be locked on.
Here is an example of a function that will only let us target __Hydras__ of __other teams__ that are __directly visible__ and __more than 50m away__
```lua
local VALID_TARGET_FUNCTION = function(vehicle)
	local targetTeam = vehicle.controller and vehicle.controller.team
	local ourTeam = localPlayer.team
	if targetTeam and ourTeam and targetTeam == ourTeam then
		return false --The target vehicle has someone driving, and both of you are on the same team
	end
	if vehicle.model ~= 520 then
		return false --Target is not a hydra, so it's not allowed
	end
	if (vehicle.position-localPlayer.position).length < 50 then
		return false --Closer than 50 metres
	end
	if not isLineOfSightClear(localPlayer.position, vehicle.position, true, false) then
		return false --Not directly visible
		--(Remember to account for your own vehicle and the target blocking the line)
	end
	return true --Target satisfied all criteria
end
```
